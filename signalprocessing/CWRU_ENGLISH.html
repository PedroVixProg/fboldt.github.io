               <li> To describe bearing failures, with normal or defective spheres (defects sown through EDM  electro-discharge  machining), a good interpretation of the database is necessary, which may contain redundant or  irrelevant  information.  Through the bearing data from Case Western Reserve University, experimental tests were carried out  for  the  bearings of the 2 hp Reliance Electric engine tests.
               </li>
               <br>
               <h4>Just to know:</h4>
               <p></p>
               <li> Bearing failures ranged between 0.007 inches in diameter and 0.040 inches in diameter, separately  introduced  in the inner and outer race.</li>
               <br>
               <li> Defective bearings were reinstalled on the test engine and vibration data was recorded for loads of  0 to  3  horsepower (engine speeds from 1797 to 1720 RPM).</li>
               <br>
               <li> Faults in the outer race are stationary faults, therefore, placing the fault in relation to the  bearing  load zone has a direct impact on the vibration response of the motor / bearing system. </li>
               <br>
               <li> Data were collected at 12,000 samples / second at 48,000 samples / second for experiments.</li>
               <br>
               <li> All fan end bearing data was collected at 12,000 samples / second.</li>
               <br>
               <li> The data files are in Matlab format. Each file contains vibration data (measured through the  accelerometers)  of the fan and the inverter, as well as the speed and power (measured through the transducers) of  the  motor  rotation. </li>
               <br>
               <h4>To understand the files name:</h4>
               <p></p>
               <li> DE - accelerometer data on the unit side;</li>
               <br>
               <li> FE - accelerometer data at the end of the fan;</li>
               <br>
               <li> BA - base accelerometer data time;</li>
               <br>
               <li> RPM - rpm during the test;</li>
               <br>
               <h4>To get to know the MATLAB files:</h4>
               <p></p>
               <li> XXX.mat â†’ 1 reading = 1,2 ou 3 signals ( simultaneously from the DE sensor and the FE sensor or the  base);
               </li>
               <br>
               <li> It is possible to identify within these simultaneous signals, who belongs to each sensor: just find  out  which  is the biggest signal, it shows that the sensor closest to you measured it, and the lowest value is  from  the  sensor  located farthest away;</li>
               <br>
               <li> About failures: or DE, or FE;</li>
               <br>
               <li> About location: or IR, or OR, or BA;</li>
               <br>
               <li> About gravity: or 007, or 014, or 021, or 028; </li>
