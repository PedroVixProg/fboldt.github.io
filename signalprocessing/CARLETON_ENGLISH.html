          <li><b>Myoelectric control (MECLab) - Pattern recognition system for prostheses controlled by myoelectropy:</b> Surface myoelectric signals (MES) can be used as an effective input for the control of arm prostheses. A system was built to discern four movements of limbs, with an accuracy of about 90% for individuals with arms and about 85% for amputees; however, users were required to control the system through contractions initiated from rest, preventing them from switching between states in a continuous and intuitive manner. </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>The process:</b> 1) resource extraction; 2) reduced resources; 3) classification. If necessary, there is the pre and/or post processing stage, with amplification, or filtering, or smoothing.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>About errors:</b> Among muscle contractions, there is the presence of errors due to this transitional period between movements, the 10 seconds of rest between attempts. Because of this, the random selection is very low efficiency, and the ULDA method for class separation was chosen. Using the LDA classifier, 92.54% effectiveness was achieved.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>About signals:</b> amplified with a gain of 1000 and band width of 1 Hz to 1kHz, by signal feature, which is 500Hz, according to the sampling theorem must be multiplied by two. Sampled in 3kHz, but resized to 1kHz for standard classification.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>About sensors:</b> electrodes in 7 locations on the forearm and 1 on the biceps. The grounding electrode is on the wrist </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>About people who were in test:</b> 30.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>7 Moviments, in classes:</b> 1- open hand, 2- close hand, 3- supination, 4- pronation, 5- wrist flexion, 6- wrist extension and 7- rest.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Repetitive movements, randomly (94 seconds/attempt):</b> 5 seconds of rest + 4 times perform 7 random movements according to the 3-second duration / movement classes. + 5 seconds rest. This is an attempt. 6 attempts were made per session. Only 1 session per day was done. </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>In this research:</b> session 4 of one of the subjects.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>To training:</b> first and second attempts of session 4.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>In test:</b> the rest 4 other attempts, were used in session 4.</li>
