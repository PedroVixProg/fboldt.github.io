               <li> There are two data inputs in the files: the accelerometer (it was adjusted in the range of + 1.5 g) and the gyroscope (it was adjusted in the measurement range of + -110 degrees). There are 9 gestures recognized through fixed sensors, all were executed once in succession, with pause between gestures (from Gesture 1 to Gesture 9).

               <li> There is a video that explains those moviments: https://github.com/pinojoke/Gestures_InertialSensors_EAAI/commit/83846ccf89720ff86269f5bf30f573041f7eeffb
